This suggests Southwest is the most consistent at sticking to their scheduled departure times."

Most airlines’ worst airports are smaller regional hubs — suggesting limited resources at these locations cause bigger problems when delays occur.\nMost airports only appear once — meaning each airline struggles at different locations. If any airport shows up multiple times, it’s a red flag that the airport itself has systemic delay issues across carriers."

The 3-day rolling average (red line) smooths out the daily noise and shows demand stayed consistent around 21,000-22,000 flights per day throughout August. The big dip at the end is August 31st (Saturday) heading into Labor Day weekend."

    "text": "Conclusion: Tips for Travelers\nBased on our analysis of August 2019 flight data, here’s how to minimize travel headaches:\n\nChoose your airline wisely — Southwest Airlines had the smallest maximum delay and sticks closest to schedule. Avoid American Airlines and Mesa Airlines for the most extreme delays.\nFly on Tuesday or Wednesday — Thursday and Friday are the busiest days with 25% more flights than other days.\nAvoid small regional airports — They have the highest average delays. The worst offender: Owensboro, KY with 94-minute average delays.\nBe cautious at Northeast hubs — LaGuardia, O’Hare, and Newark lead in cancellations, mostly due to air traffic control issues.\nExpect weekly patterns — Saturdays have fewer flights, while Thursday/Friday peak. Plan connections accordingly.\n\nSafe travels!"
